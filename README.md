# Career_Path_AndroidStudio
Application in Android Studio suggesting a possible career path for a computing science student


For the final project in Mobile Application and Development Class,
I decided to create a Career Path Planning Application for an IT industry.
After graduating with computing science degree or diploma, many of us are wondering what shall we do next in regards with our career choice. 
My application will go over number of questions regarding User’s personal interests and experiences.
Depending on the answers, they will be offered a potential Career Path in IT industry.
The User will learn about a certain profession in IT field, the job functionalities and current median salary in Canada. 
This application will have more entertaining, and educational purpose and will not mean that the User cannot decide on a different Career Path.
All the information will be just an app’s author recommendation and personal point of view. 
In terms of an application flow, the application will start with a Greeting Page.
From there, the User can navigate to a short questionnaire. 
From questionnaire the User, will navigate to an Activity containing information on suggested Career Path.
Each Activity describing a Career Path will contain the name of the Profession in IT field,
some picture for a better visual representation, short description of work duties, necessary education and certification level and salary.
From Career Path Activity the User will be able to navigate back to a Questionnaire Activity and retake the test. 
I am planning to use intents to navigate between Activities. 
The application will also make sure that the User answered to all the questions prior to taking him or her to the next Activity. 
If the question left unanswered, the toast message will be displayed. 
I am also planning to incorporate preferences that will persist the application state. 
In terms of the overall look of the application, I would like to keep it clean, minimalistic and simple.
This is just a personal choice that reflects the author’s personal preferences.
